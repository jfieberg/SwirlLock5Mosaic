  Lesson: 2.3 - Quantitative variable plots
  Author: Nick Gondek and John Fieberg
  Type: Standard
  Organization: University of Minnesota
  Version: 2.4.2

- Class: figure
  Output: Just like we did with categorical variables, we'll now take a look at how we vizualize quantitative variables. Again, we will use the ggformula package to create our plots.
  Figure: student.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just like the last couple of lessons, I've put the dataset "StudentSurvey" into your workspace (the upper right panel). Click on the name to open it up.
  CorrectAnswer: View(StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: No need to type anything into the console - just click on StudentSurvey in the upper right panel.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: One of the most common ways we vizualize quantitative data is to use a histogram. A histogram is a useful way to eyeball where most of our data might fall for a particular variable. For example, let's look at the distribution of SAT scores across the students who took the survey. Try it now using gf_histogram(~SAT, data=StudentSurvey).
  CorrectAnswer: gf_histogram(~SAT, data=StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gf_histogram(~SAT, data=StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: Enter the following code exactly, gf_histogram(~SAT, data=StudentSurvey)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Using the histogram we just generated, which SAT score is most common amongst the survey takers? 
  AnswerChoices: about 1000;about 1200;about 1400
  CorrectAnswer: about 1200
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='about 1200')
  Hint: Since we are looking at the frequency (how many of the students have a SAT score that fall into each bin), we are looking for the highest bar in the plot. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Another common way to visualize a single quantitative variable is to use a density plot (essentially, a smooth histogram). We'll use the same format as a histogram, except this time, we use the gf_density() function. Try it using the GPA variable - gf_density(~GPA, data=StudentSurvey).
  CorrectAnswer: gf_density(~GPA, data=StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gf_density(~GPA, data=StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: Don't forget the ~.  Try this, gf_density(~GPA, data=StudentSurvey)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Great job. Using the density plot we just created, which GPA was most frequent for the students who took the survey?
  AnswerChoices: 2.0;3.2;4.0
  CorrectAnswer: 3.2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='3.2')
  Hint: Again, we're looking for the peak of the data!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just like with the categorical plots, we can create a multi-panel plot using  "|" with a second categorical variable. This time, we'll explore how the distribution of the number of piercings differs between smokers and non-smokers. Try it out now - gf_density(~Piercings | Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)
  CorrectAnswer: gf_density(~Piercings | Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gf_density(~Piercings | Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: Remember to use the ~ in front of Piercings! Try it - gf_density(~Piercings | Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: This plot looks a little strange since the number of piercings can only take on integer values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...). In addition, it would be easier to compare the two groups if the distributions were overlayed within the same graph. We can do this using the fill argument. Try it out now -  gf_density(~Piercings, fill=~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)
  CorrectAnswer:  gf_density(~Piercings, fill=~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr=' gf_density(~Piercings, fill=~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: Remember to use the ~ in front of Piercings and also Smoke! Try it -  gf_density(~Piercings, fill=~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Looking at our density plot, what number of piercings is most common for non-smokers? Well, the answer is 0. But, what is the most common number of piercings for non-smokers with at least 1 piercing? 
  CorrectAnswer: 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=2)
  Hint: Look at the legend! Since R has automatically assigned colors, the pink density denotes non-smokers and the blue line denotes smokers. The number you report should be an integer (1, 2, 3, 4,...).
