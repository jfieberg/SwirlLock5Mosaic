- Class: text
  Output: Almost done with Pre-lab 1! In the last section, we learned how to find the mean, max and min number of pieces in the observations contained in the lego data set. In this section, we'll use the filter function to manipulate our data. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What if we wanted to see all of the cases that have just 1 lego piece.  We could use the function filter() to filter out all cases that meet this criterion! The syntax for the filter function is - filter(data, criterion). To identify the cases with just 1 lego piece, we would use - filter(legos, pieces==1).
  CorrectAnswer: filter(legos, pieces==1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='filter(legos, pieces==1)')
  Hint: Using the code - filter(legos, pieces==1) - we are telling R to filter the legos dataset, and only select cases where the number of pieces is equal to 1.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We see that there are 12 cases in the dataset that have a single lego piece!  What if we wanted to select all cases that have the 'Classic' theme?  In this case, we would use, filter(legos, theme=='Classic')
  CorrectAnswer: filter(legos, theme=='Classic')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('filter(legos, theme==\'Classic\')', 'filter(legos, theme==\"Classic\")')
  Hint: Make sure to use a == and that Classic starts with a capitol C, filter(legos, theme=='Classic')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now your turn - filter the data set to include only the cases that cost over 6 dollars in price. I.e., we want the variable price > 6.
  CorrectAnswer: filter(legos, price > 6)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('filter(legos, price > 6)')
  Hint: We need to use the price variable and indicate that we are interested in observations where price is greater than 6, filter(legos, price > 6)

- Class: text
  Output: Great work! Using filter, we can chose specific rows of data from a dataset - you'll use this for analysis purposes in lab.
